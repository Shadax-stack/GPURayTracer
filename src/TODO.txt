This is the todo list

Things I need to do:
- DONE: Create a CPU side controlled camera with adjustable perspectivity 
- DONE: Allow that camera to move and look around
- DONE: Replace the ray-sphere intersection with a ray-triangle intersection
- DONE: Send the triangles to the shader using a SSBO or texture
- DONE: Dynamically load the triangles with ASSIMP
- Basic acceleration structures and bounding volumes
- Wavefront ray tracing
- Monte carlo path tracing

Issues that I need to fix:
- Ray triangle intersection and hidden surface removal is broken, maybe I should move to watertight intersection

Things I should do but don't need to:
- Fix OpenGL abstraction issues
- Add GLSL include directory functionality

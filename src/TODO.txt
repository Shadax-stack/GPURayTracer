Haha, time flies, right? Since I'm visiting this project after a year, everything below the line goes in the garbage until I can clear my mind about what to do.

TODO LIST:
- Get to know my project again
- REWRITE AND REORGANIZE EVERYTHING!!!!!
- Fix bugs and whatnot

My vision for this project is getting a proper path tracer up and running only within OpenGL by next summer. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the todo list

Things I need to do:
- DONE: Create a CPU side controlled camera with adjustable perspectivity 
- DONE: Allow that camera to move and look around
- DONE: Replace the ray-sphere intersection with a ray-triangle intersection
- DONE: Send the triangles to the shader using a SSBO or texture
- DONE: Dynamically load the triangles with ASSIMP
- DONE: Bounding volumes
- DONE: Bounding volume hierarchies 
- DONE: Texturing
- Better BVH building and traversal
- Wavefront ray tracing
- Scene loading
- Scene management system
- Monte carlo path tracing
- Post processing
- PARTIALLY DONE: Physically based rendering
- Importance sampling
- Multiple importance samping

Issues that I need to fix:
- FIXED: Ray triangle intersection and hidden surface removal is broken

Things I should do but don't need to:
- Fix OpenGL abstraction issues
- DONE: Add GLSL include directory functionality 
- Fix memory leaks and OpenGL resource "leaks" after the program exits

Things maybe I should do:
- Move to watertight triangle intersection

This is the todo list

Things I need to do:
- DONE: Create a CPU side controlled camera with adjustable perspectivity 
- DONE: Allow that camera to move and look around
- DONE: Replace the ray-sphere intersection with a ray-triangle intersection
- DONE: Send the triangles to the shader using a SSBO or texture
- DONE: Dynamically load the triangles with ASSIMP
- DONE: Bounding volumes
- Bounding volume hierarchies 
- Texturing
- DONE: Wavefront ray tracing
- Scene loading
- Scene management system
- Monte carlo path tracing
- Post processing
- Physically based rendering
- Importance sampling
- Multiple importance samping

Issues that I need to fix:
- FIXED: Ray triangle intersection and hidden surface removal is broken

Things I should do but don't need to:
- Fix OpenGL abstraction issues
- Add GLSL include directory functionality 
- Fix memory leaks and OpenGL resource "leaks" after the program exits

Things maybe I should do:
- Move to watertight triangle intersection
